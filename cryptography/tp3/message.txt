Etymology
The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and 
is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities,
 innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[5]
  In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation 
  of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic
   characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop
    of their own accord.[6][7] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe,
     is one of several expansions of the original notion;[2] it began with certain core
      applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a 
      dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.
